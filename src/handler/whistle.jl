Handle whistle blower reports. The complete flow is as follows:

1. Reporter places a special emoji on the potentially inappropriate message
2. This handler function is called.
3. Increment the counter for whistle blower reports on the reported message
4. If there are enough reports, delete the reported message
5. Otherwise, just remove the emoji.
6. Send a DM to the report about the action that's taken.
7. Log an audit event.
